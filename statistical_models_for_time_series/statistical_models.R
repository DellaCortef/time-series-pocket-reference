# Statistical Models for Time Series
##### We will map some linear statistical models to **time series**.
##### These models are related to linear regression, but represent 
##### correlations between data points in the same **time series**, 
##### unlike standard methods applied to cross-sectional data, where 
##### Each data point is assumed to be independent of the others in the sample. 
##### We will analyze the following models:
  ##### - autoregressive models (AR), moving average models (MA) and models 
  ##### autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA);
  ##### - vector autoregression (VAR);
  ##### - hierarchical models;
##### Traditionally, these models have been the driving force in forecasting 
##### **time series** and continue to be used in a wide range of 
##### situations, from academic research to modeling in various fields 
##### of acting.
