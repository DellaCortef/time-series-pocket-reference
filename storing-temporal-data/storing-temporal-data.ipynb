    "# Storing Temporal Data\n",
    "In general, the value of **time series** data is in its retrospective (batch ingestion model), rather than in the live streaming of data. For this reason, storing **time series** data is necessary for most analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good storage solution is one that allows for easy access and reliability of data without requiring a large investment of computing resources. Later, we will look at what aspects of a dataset we should consider for storage, as well as examine the advantages of SQL databases, NoSQL databases, and a variety of flat file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a general **time series** storage solution is challenging because there are many different types of data, each with different storage, read/write, and analysis patterns. Some data will be stored and examined repeatedly, while others are only useful for a short period of time, after which they may be deleted entirely."

    "Use cases:\n",
    "*Importance of how performance scales with size*\n",
    "- in the first use case, we would look for a solution that could incorporate automated scripts to delete old data. We wouldn't be concerned about how the system scales to large datasets, as we plan to keep the dataset small. For the second and third case, we would expect to have a large and stable collection of data or a large and growing collection of data, respectively;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Importance of random access versus sequential access of data points*\n",
    "- in the second case, we expect all data to be accessed in equal parts, since this **time series** data would all have the same \"age\" upon insertion and would all reference the relevant data set. In contrast, in the first and third cases, we expect the most recent data to be accessed more frequently;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Importance of automation scripts*\n",
    "- apparently, the first case can be automated, while the second case would not require automation (since the data would be immutable). The third case suggests little automation, and also a considerable amount of data collection and processing of all parts of the data, not just the most recent ones. In the first case, we want a storage solution that can be integrated with scripts or stored procedures, while in the third case we want a solution that allows easy customization of data processing;"
