# Exploratory Data Analysis

### Known Methods

#### Data exploration techniques typically used on **time series** datasets. 
#### The process is the same as that used for data that are not time series 
#### (for example, cross-sectional data). We would like to know the available 
#### columns, their value ranges, and which logical units of measurement 
#### work best.

#### Questions to ask:
  #### Are there strong correlations between the columns? Which?
  #### What is the overall mean of a relevant variable? What is your variance?
  #### What is the range of values we perceive? Do they vary by time period 
  #### or other logical unit of analysis?
  #### Does the data seem consistent and measured in a uniform way, or does it 
  #### suggest changes in measurement or behavior over time?
  
#### To answer the questions, we can use known techniques, such as:
  #### plotting;
  #### statistical synthesis;
  #### histograms;
  #### scatter plots;

#### To answer all these questions, it is necessary that the methods mentioned 
#### above take the temporal axis into account. And to implement this behavior, 
#### we will incorporate time into our statistics as an axis in our graphs or 
#### as *group by* operations.
