This is one of the negative aspects of temporal data: no two data points in the same time series are exactly comparable, as these points occur at different times. If we want to think about *what could have happened in a given time*, we enter the world of simulation."

    "\n",
    "Simulation and forecasting are similar practices. In both, we must formulate hypotheses about the dynamics and parameters of the underlying system and then extrapolate from these hypotheses in order to generate data points. However, there are important differences to consider when learning and developing simulations rather than predictions:\n",
    "- it may be easier to integrate qualitative observations into a simulation than into a prediction;\n",
    "- simulations are run at scale, so that we can analyze several alternative scenarios, while forecasts must be generated with more care;\n",
    "- the risks of simulations are lower than predictions, as there are no lives or resources at stake. Therefore, you can be more creative and exploratory in your initial rounds of simulations. Obviously, sooner or later, you want to be sure that you can justify how you build your simulations, just as you justify your predictions."
