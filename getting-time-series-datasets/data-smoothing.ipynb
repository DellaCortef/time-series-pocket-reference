    "Although detecting *outliers* is a very broad topic, we can do the same using moving averages on **time series** data, eliminating *spikes*, measurement errors, or both. Even though the *spikes are accurate*, they \n",
    "may not reflect the underlying process and may be more a matter of instrumentation issues, so it is common to smooth the data.\n",

    "Data smoothing is closely related to missing data imputation. Thus, some of \n",
