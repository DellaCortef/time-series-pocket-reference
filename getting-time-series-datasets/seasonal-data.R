############################### Seasonal Data #################################

### When it comes to data, seasonality is any type of recurring behavior in 
### which the frequency is stable. It can occur at many different frequencies 
### and at the same time. For example, human behavior is prone to having a daily 
### seasonality (always having lunch at the same time), a weekly seasonality 
### (going to the gym every Monday), and an annual seasonality (little traffic 
### on New Year's Day). Physical periods also have seasonality, such as the 
### period it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun.
